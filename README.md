# Sort Duplex Scan PDF

This Python script combines two PDF documents generated by scanning a stack of duplex-printed papers with a single-face scanner. It works with python 2.7 and up, and depends on the Python Package `pdfrw`.

# Installation
## Dependencies

When running the script without the Automator wrapper, the `pdfrw` can be installed via pip

```bash
pip install pdfrw
```

Running the script as a Service through Automator requires using the OS default Python installation `/usr/bin/python`. The dependency can be installed using easy_install but requires super user privileges.

```bash
sudo /usr/bin/easy_install pdfrw
```

## Automator Service

Doubleclick on the workflow and it should allow you to install it as a Service. If this does not work, follow these steps:

1. Open the Workflow in Automator.app
1. Via the Menu: `File` -> `Convert to...` -> `Service`
1. At the top of the Workflow, choose `Accepts PDF Files` and `Finder.app`
