# Combine-Duplex-Scan-Automator-Workflow

This Automator Workflow combines two PDF documents generated by scanning a stack of duplex-printed papers with a single-face scanner. It merely needs to know which file contains the fronts and which the backs, and then spits out a `combined.pdf` onto the Desktop.

# Installation

open Workflow in Automator.app, under Menu File -> Convert to... -> Service

at the top of the workflow, choose `accepts no input` and `Finder.app`
